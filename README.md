# PartNumberRegister
Generic Part Register For Engineering Companies. Using Django

In my experience at engineering companies, many of them use excel to keep part number records.
This is bad practice and very hard to maintain or search.

Rather than invest in often expensive PDM , This is a lightweight Web application for engineering companies to create part numbers which
can be accessed anywhere by any user. It also has functionality to assign parts to higher level projects.

Read and Write Access can be set for individual users.
